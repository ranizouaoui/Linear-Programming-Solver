## Introduction

Linear programming is a mathematical technique used to optimize a system with linear constraints. This repository offers Python implementations of two powerful methods for solving linear programming problems: the Big M Method and the Graphic Method.

## Features

- Implementation of the Big M Method for solving linear programming problems.
- Implementation of the Graphic Method for visualization and solving.
- Easy-to-understand code structure and examples.
- Usage instructions and explanations of concepts.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository: https://github.com/ranizouaoui/Linear-Programming-Solver/
```
cd linear-programming-solver
```
2. Run the solver:
```
pip install -r "requirements.txt"
python solver.py
```

3. Follow the prompts to select the method and input the problem parameters.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Whether you want to enhance the solvers, add more methods, or improve documentation, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
